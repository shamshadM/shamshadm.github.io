<p>Abstract: The present investigation was carried out at the research fields of the oilseeds Sections Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India. The material for present study consisted of 31 germplasm lines. The material was raised in two rows with three replications each row of 4.5 m length with 60 cm and 30 cm inter and intra row spacing respectively, in the randomized block design. All the agronomic practices recommended for the region were followed to raise a good crop. The data for agronomic and yield traits i.e. plant heights, head diameters, volume weights, 100 seed weights, seed yield per plant was recorded. D2 analysis assigned the test genotypes into six clusters indicating presence of enough genetic diversity in the material. All the 31 germplasm lines were grouped into six clusters. The critical examination of clusters indicated the presence of high level of genetic diversity in the material. Cluster I comprised of maximum number of lines (18) and cluster III (9) cluster IIs IVs V and VI each consist one line respectively in normal environment. The genotypes included in the same cluster are considered genetically similar with respect to the aggregate effect of the characters examined the hybridization attempted between these is not expected to yield desirable recombinants. Therefore, putative parents for crossing programme should belong to different clusters characterized by large inter-cluster distance. The intra cluster distances ranged from 0 (cluster II, IV, V and VI) to 417.294 (cluster I) indicating presence of only one line in cluster II, IV, V and VI whereas, genotypes in cluster I were more dissimilar in agronomic and yield traits than other clusters. The maximum inter-cluster distance was observed between the members of cluster II with cluster VI (12836.64) followed by cluster I with cluster VI (7084.305) cluster V with cluster VI (6600.998) and cluster II with cluster IV (6498.283). The genotypes NC-41B (Morden), HOAL-38, P61R and TX-16R grouped in different clusters were identified as the most divers genotypes and should be used in hybridization program to realize high heterosis for these traits.</p>
