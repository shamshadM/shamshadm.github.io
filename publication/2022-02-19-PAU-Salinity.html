<meta name="description" content="The commercial wheat genotypes released for cultivation under timely sown irrigated conditions in Punjab along with known salt tolerant genotypes and few advance breeding lines were evaluated for salt stress tolerance at seedling stage under simulated stress conditions and at adult plant stage in actual saline fields at Rattakhera, Sri Mukatsar Sahib (Punjab), to find out the best suitable wheat variety for the salt affected areas. Twelve wheat varieties, seven advance breeding lines, one wheat genotype popular in salt stressed regions of Punjab and Kharchia, a universal donor for stress tolerance to salt were tested.
