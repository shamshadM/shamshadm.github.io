Field experimental analysis is a research method that uses controlled interventions within a real-world setting to study cause-and-effect relationships. Unlike a lab experiment, which maximizes control in an artificial environment, a field experiment prioritizes testing an intervention in a natural setting to improve the real-world applicability of its findings. This trade-off between internal validity (control) and external validity (real-world applicability) is a core consideration in the design and interpretation of field experiments.
