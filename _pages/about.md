I am from :india: and work as a [Post-Doctoral Researcher](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-mohammad-shamshad) in the **[Transforming India's Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable food Supplies](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/fps/FP3)** at the [University of Cambridge](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-mohammad-shamshad) in Cambridge :uk:.

My work focus :dart: on the development and evaluation of high-yielding, diseases resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance crops. [shamshad.in](https://www.shamshad.in) is my blog to keep track :spiral_notepad: of my projects and different HOW TOs related to data :microscope: and tech :satellite:.

I am passionate about Agriculture and cutting-edge technologies. I have a solid :fountain_pen: understanding and rigorous :pushpin: hands-on experience in field of plant breeding, quantitative genetics, computational biology :gear: and high throughput phenotyping, which I earned during my academic and research work with plant breeder/geneticists, bioinformaticist, and pathologists in my undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral career :hear_no_evil:.

I have professional Expertise in Plant Breeding :innocent:, Quantitative Genetics, Genomics and computational biology. I am passionate :heart_eyes: about Experimental Design, Data Analysis and Visualization using R, SAS, jmp SAS, python, UNIX/Linux, HTML/CSS, Git and GitHub. I have worked experience in DNA extraction, PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and Microscopy :microscope:.
